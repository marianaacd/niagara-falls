            <h2>HISTORY OF NIAGARA FALLS</h2>
          <hr>
          <h3>The Formation of Niagara Falls</h3>
          <p>Niagara Falls consists of two waterfalls on the Niagara River, which marks the border between New York and Ontario, Canada: the American Falls, located on the American side of the border, and the Canadian or Horseshoe Falls located on the Canadian side. To the right of the American Falls is a smaller waterfall that has been separated from the American Falls by natural forces, which is usually called Bridal Veil Falls.
          </p>
          <p> It is estimated that 12,000 years ago when the falls were formed, the edge of the falls was as much as seven miles further down river than it is today. Until the 1950s, when the flow of water began to be controlled, the brink of the falls moved backward an estimated three feet every year because of erosion. Year after year, the formation continues with the annual freezing and thawing of the Niagara River, along with gradual erosion and periodic rock-falls. Remedial work has been completed to preserve the Falls and the volume of water has been reduced by diversion for hydroelectric power.

                <h5>NIGHTLY ILLUMINATION</h5>
                <hr>
                <p>Every evening beginning at dusk, Niagara Falls is transformed into an incredible, multi-coloured water and light masterpiece.Special lights are housed in the Illumination Tower, next to Queen Victoria Place; on the roof of Table Rock Centre, at the brink of the Horseshoe Falls; and deep in the Niagara Gorge, across from the American Falls. Together, these lights work to create a breathtaking view not to be missed. The falls are also lit in custom colours for short durations to mark significant dates in support of charitable causes. </p> 
                <p>Niagara Falls illumination is a must for any visitor! Every night of the year, the three waterfalls that make up Niagara Falls are illuminated in glowing colours creating a stunning vista that can be viewed from near and far, from 8:30 pm to 2:00 am. </p>
